      <p>Nobody (SONG)</p>
      <p>"Nobody" is a song by American singer Mitski, released in 2018 as the second single from her fifth studio album, Be the Cowboy.
        The Harvard Crimson, considering the song to be about loneliness, wrote that it is eerily upbeat, with melancholic lyrics contradicting its catchy
        melody.</p>
      <p>A music video for the song was released on the same day as the single, directed by Christopher Good. About the music video, Mitski said "We shot this
        video over five days, in both sides of Kansas City. I've never been able to take this much time to shoot a video, so it was wonderful to have the space
        to get the details right, as well as actually hang out and have fun with everyone involved. "This video made me fall unexpectedly in love with Kansas City."</p>
